Soon his paintings were championed by a younger generation of artists, who prized his directness of manner, visionary imagination, formal daring, and apparent lack of sophistication[...] While the Parisian avant-garde celebrated the exotic motifs and deliberately primitivizing style of his jungle paintings, American audiences were equally enamored of his landscapes, portraits, and urban scenes.",

By 1911, disconcerted by the lack of attention his paintings attracted, he had renounced his formal training and transitioned to an entirely self-conscious and seemingly self-taught style.",

    "bio": "Generally untrained and itinerant, limners were a class of artists who helped shape the image of colonial Americans, securing the social status of their middle-class sitters in portraits that convey an air of refinement. “The Gansevoort Limner” designates an unidentified artist who was active in the US between 1730 and 1745 (possibly Pieter Vanderlyn) and depicted, among others, the Gansevoorts, a prominent Dutch American family. Typically set within domestic interiors, this artist’s flatly painted, three-quarter-length likenesses represent his prospering sitters with a naturalism that is loosely indebted to seventeenth-century Dutch portraiture",

Claiming divine inspiration, he soon branched out into garden ornaments and sculpture. Edmondson carved tombstones from discarded pieces of limestone with railroad spikes and a hammer. Many of his motifs derived from African American burial traditions, and his clients came from the local community.",

    "bio": "Under the auspices of the WPA, Johnson found employment teaching art in Harlem, where the neighborhood and its artistic community inspired him to change the style and subjects of his paintings[...] he adopted a self-consciously vernacular style marked by vivid colors and flat, distorted compositions, looking to African sculpture and African American models for inspiration. His new subject matter included Harlem life, the rural south, and religious scenes as well as biting indictments of racism and celebrations of African American heroes and historical figures.",

His admiration for musicians and independent-minded artists merges in a series of hand-carved, functional guitar sculptures of the 1980s that he dedicated to figures like Muddy Waters and Joseph Beuys.",
